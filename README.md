# Ski-Resort-Dashboard
The ski resort dashboard is a a small web app designed to display aggregated data about some of the local ski resorts that I like to frequent in Colorado. The idea is similar to what OnTheSnow does, but with a slightly more focused goal on displaying the historical weather data of each resort. The reason for this is to try and get a slighly better picture of what conditions will be like on the mountain.
